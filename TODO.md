# Structure

* The test should maybe show a green check mark
* Each Koan should have a Haddocked substructure
* If bug in HLS can't be solved, provide my own hie.yaml

## CI

* Check cabal outdated
* Check in diffs between solution and problem and make sure it is stable (such that every fix in a solution gets propagated to the problem and vice versa)
